However, as normal as this may sound, this is more than just pollution we see every day. The road beside the metro station is strewn with illegally dumped Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste. On the way to office every day, Balaji Ragotham comes across large tractors dumping C&D waste on the side of the road in eastern Bengaluru\\'s KR Puram. \"I have spoken to them often. However, they never tend to listen,\" he added. Sandeep Anirudhan, Convenor of Citizens’ Agenda for Bengaluru, said that from Bellandur Lake to Varthur Lake, the road is littered with C&D waste. \"All across Bengaluru, C&D waste can be seen almost everywhere, be it roads, lake beds or just wetlands,\" he added. C&D waste is generated from the construction, renovation, repair, and demolition of houses, roads, and other real estate works. Contrary to popular misconception, most common C&D waste like soil can contain hazardous materials and heavy metals that damage the environmental ecosystem. \"This is not just Karnataka\\'s growing problem, it is prevalent across the country,\" Ashish Vashisht, a lawyer and National Green Tribunal activist, said. The damage it does to the environment is equivalent to that wrought by plastic or other forms of waste, he added.',\n",
